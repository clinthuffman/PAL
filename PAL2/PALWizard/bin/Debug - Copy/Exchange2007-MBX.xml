    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the processor spends to execute a non-Idle thread. It is calculated by measuring the duration of the idle thread is active in the sample interval, and subtracting that time from interval duration.  (Each processor has an idle thread that consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). This counter is the primary indicator of processor activity, and displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval. It is calculated by monitoring the time that the service is inactive, and subtracting that value from 100%.

This analysis checks for utilization greater than 60% on each individual processor. If so, determine if it is high user mode CPU or high privileged mode. If high privileged mode CPU is suspected, then see the Privileged Mode CPU Analysis. If a user-mode processor bottleneck is suspected, then consider using a process profiler to analyze the functions causing the high CPU consumption. See â€œHow To: Identify Functions causing a High User-mode CPU Bottleneck for Server Applications in a Production Environmentâ€ article in the references section for more information.<BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Bytes Total/sec is the rate at which bytes are sent and received over each network adapter, including framing characters. Network Interface\Bytes Received/sec is a sum of Network Interface\Bytes Received/sec and Network Interface\Bytes Sent/sec. This counter indicates the rate at which bytes are sent and received over each network adapter. This counter helps you know whether the traffic at your network adapter is saturated and if you need to add another network adapter. How quickly you can identify a problem depends on the type of network you have as well as whether you share bandwidth with other applications.<BR>
<BR>
This analysis converts Bytes Total/sec to bits and compares it to the current bandwidth of the network adapter to calculate network utilization. Next, it checks for utilization above 50%.

  <ANALYSIS NAME="Processor Queue Length" ENABLED="True" CATEGORY="System" PRIMARYDATASOURCE="\System\Processor Queue Length" ID="{e9f0d5be-bd81-4932-a18d-df3852c85315}" FROMALLCOUNTERSTATS="False">
    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Processor Queue Length is the number of threads in the processor queue.  Unlike the disk counters, this counter counters, this counter shows ready threads only, not threads that are running.  There is a single queue for processor time even on computers with multiple processors. Therefore, if a computer has multiple processors, you need to divide this value by the number of processors servicing the workload. A sustained processor queue of less than 5 threads per processor is normally acceptable, dependent of the workload.<BR>
<BR>
This analysis determines if the average processor queue length exceeds the number of processors. If so, then this could indicate a processor bottleneck. Use this analysis in correlation with Privileged Mode CPU Analysis and â€œExcessive Processor Use by Processâ€ analysis.<BR>
<BR>
If there are more tasks ready to run than there are processors, threads queue up. The processor queue is the collection of threads that are ready but not able to be executed by the processor because another active thread is currently executing. A sustained or recurring queue of more threads than number of processors is a good indication of a processor bottleneck.<BR>
<BR>
You can use this counter in conjunction with the Processor\% Processor Time counter to determine if your application can benefit from more CPUs. There is a single queue for processor time, even on multiprocessor computers. Therefore, in a multiprocessor computer, divide the Processor Queue Length (PQL) value by the number of processors servicing the workload.<BR>
<BR>
If the CPU is very busy (90 percent and higher utilization) and the PQL average is consistently higher than the number of processors, then you may have a processor bottleneck that could benefit from additional CPUs. Or, you could reduce the number of threads and queue more at the application level. This will cause less context switching, and less context switching is good for reducing CPU load. The common reason for a high PQL with low CPU utilization is that requests for processor time arrive randomly and threads demand irregular amounts of time from the processor. This means that the processor is not a bottleneck but that it is your threading logic that needs to be improved.<BR>
<BR>
If a user-mode processor bottleneck is suspected, then consider using a process profiler to analyze the functions causing the high CPU consumption. See â€œHow To: Identify Functions causing a High User-mode CPU Bottleneck for Server Applications in a Production Environmentâ€ article in the references section for more information.<BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Free System Page Table Entries is the number of page table entries not currently in used by the system. This analysis determines if the system is running out of free system page table entries (PTEs) by checking if there is less than 5,000 free PTEâ€™s with a Warning if there is less than 10,000 free PTEâ€™s. Lack of enough PTEs can result in system wide hangs. Also note that the /3GB switch will lower the amount of free PTEs significantly. <BR>
<BR>
The Performance Monitor â€œMemory\Free System Page Table Entriesâ€ counter is inaccurate on installations of Windows Server 2003 without Service Pack 1.

<BR>
<B>Fix for Win2003 SP1 systems with /3GB and low on PTEâ€™s:</B> If the system is low on PTEâ€™s, running Windows 2003, and using /3GB switch, then consider using the /USERVA switch to give back some of the memory to the kernel. Note, this only works for Free System PTE issues.<BR>

<BR>
This analysis checks to see if the system is becoming close to the maximum Pool Nonpaged memory size. It does this by estimating the pool sizes taking into consideration /3GB, physical memory size, and 32-bit/64-bit, then determining if the value is higher than 60% of the estimated pool size. If the system becomes close to the maximum size, then the system could experience system wide hangs. Checks both 32-bit and 64-bit memory pools. Warning: The /3GB switch option in the boot.ini file significantly reduces the size of this memory pool.<BR>
<BR>
If the system is low on Paged Pool or non-Paged pool memory, then it is recommended to open a support case with Microsoft to address this. Alternatively, you can use a free and public tool called Poolmon.exe to see what DLLâ€™s are using kernel memory (see the article below). Most kernel memory leaks can be tracked back to a usermode process. To identify which user mode process is responsible, reboot the system (so you start off with a clean system), start a performance monitor log intending to run for a week or more capturing the Memory and Process objects, then analyze the perfmon log looking for memory leaks and/or handle leaks in one or more of the processes. In any case, migrating to a 64-bit version of Windows should alleviate this issue.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Available MBytes is the amount of physical memory available to processes running on the computer, in Megabytes, rather than bytes as reported in Memory\Available Bytes. The Virtual Memory Manager continually adjusts the space used in physical memory and on disk to maintain a minimum number of available bytes for the operating system and processes. When available bytes are plentiful, the Virtual Memory Manager lets the working sets of processes grow, or keeps them stable by removing an old page for each new page added. When available bytes are few, the Virtual Memory Manager must trim the working sets of processes to maintain the minimum required.

This analysis checks to see if the total available memory is low â€“ Warning at 10% available and Critical at 5% available. A Warning is also alerted when a decreasing trend of 10MBâ€™s per hour is detecting indicating a potential upcoming memory condition. Low physical memory can cause increased privileged mode CPU and system delays. <BR>

<BR>
This counter should always be below 1000, therefore this analysis checks for values above 1000. Use this analysis in correlation with Available Memory Analysis and Memory Leak Analysis. All are throwing alerts at the same time, then this may indicate the system is running out of memory and the suspected processes involved and follow analysis steps mentioned in the Memory Leak analysis.<BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[High context switching is only a problem if privileged mode CPU and overall CPU is high as well. This analysis checks for high CPU, high privileged mode CPU, and high system context switches per sec.<BR>
<BR>
Threshold: As a general rule, context switching rates of less than 5,000 per second per processor are not worth worrying about. If context switching rates exceed 15,000 per second per processor, then there is a constraint.<BR>
<BR>
Significance: Context switching happens when a higher priority thread preempts a lower priority thread that is currently running or when a high priority thread blocks. High levels of context switching can occur when many threads share the same priority level. This often indicates that there are too many threads competing for the processors on the system. If you do not see much processor utilization and you see very low levels of context switching, it could indicate that threads are blocked.<BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[This analysis determines if any of the processes are consuming a large size of the system's memory and if the process is increasing in memory consumption over time. A process consuming large portions of memory is okay as long as the process returns the memory back to the system. Look for increasing trends in the chart. An increasing trend over a long period of time could indicate a memory leak. Private Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of memory that this process has allocated that cannot be shared with other processes. This analysis checks for a 10MBâ€™s per hour and 5MBâ€™s per hour increasing trends. Use this analysis in correlation with the Available Memory analysis.<BR>
<BR>
Also, keep in mind that newly started processes will initially appear as a memory leak when it is simply normal start up behavior. A memory leak is when a process continues to consume memory and not releasing memory over a long period of time.<BR>

This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system clock, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices. These devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require attention. Normal thread execution is suspended during interrupts. Most system clocks interrupt the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity. A dramatic increase in this counter indicates potential hardware problems.<BR>

- Outdated HP ILO driver causing kernel memory allocation problems. See <A HREF="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998677.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998677.aspx</a><br>
<br>
- Outdated Broadcom network card drivers with the Scalable Networking Pack chimney features enabled causing process working sets to get trimmed. Updating to the latest network card driver to VBD version 3.7x or later will help with this situation. See <A HREF="http://www.broadcom.com/support/ethernet_nic/netxtremeii.php">http://www.broadcom.com/support/ethernet_nic/netxtremeii.php</a> for more information on the update drivers. Certain OEM's have updated their drivers, so check with your server manufacturer before applying any update directly from the Broadcom site.<br>
<br>
<b>Hotfix:</b><br>
<br>
Applying <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938486">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938486</a> will help reduce the amount that the working sets are trimmed preventing server performance issues due to excessive paging. <b>Note:</b> Any driver that calls the function MMAllocateContiguousMemory in large blocks may cause working sets to get trimmed. Exchange 2007 caches most data in memory and any trimming of any working sets will be detremental to overall performance.<br>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[
      The total number of managed exceptions thrown per second. As this number increases, performance degrades. Exceptions should not be thrown as part of normal processing. Note, however, that Response.Redirect, Server.Transfer, and Response.End all cause a ThreadAbortException to be thrown multiple times, and a site that relies heavily upon these methods will incur a performance penalty. If you must use Response.Redirect, call Response.Redirect(url, false), which does not call Response.End, and hence does not throw. The downside is that the user code that follows the call to Response.Redirect(url, false) will execute. It is also possible to use a static HTML page to redirect. Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 312629 provides further detail. In addition to monitoring this very useful performance counter, the Application_Error event should be used in order to alert administrators to problems.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[
      The number of bytes committed by managed objects. This is the sum of the large object heap and the generation 0, 1, and 2 heaps. These regions of memory are of type MEM_COMMIT (see Platform SDK documentation for VirtualAlloc). The value of this counter will always be less than the value of Process\Private Bytes, which counts all MEM_COMMIT regions for the process. Private Bytes minus # Bytes in all Heaps is the number of bytes committed by unmanaged objects. The first step in the investigation of excessive memory usage is to determine whether it is being used by managed or unmanaged objects. To investigate excessive managed memory usage, I recommend WINDBG.EXE and SOS.DLL, which you can read about in Production Debugging for .NET Framework Applications. SOS.DLL has a "!dumpheap â€“stat" command that lists the count, size, and type of objects in the managed heap. You can use "!dumpheap â€“mt" to obtain the address of an object, and "!gcroot" to see its roots. The command "!eeheap" presents memory usage statistics for the managed heaps. 
      <P>
      Another useful tool for diagnosing memory usage is the CLR Profiler, discussed in more detail below. 
      <P>
      Excessive managed memory usage is commonly caused by: 
      <OL type="a">
        <LI>Reading large data sets into memory.</LI>
        <LI>Creating excessive cache entries.</LI>
        <LI>Uploading or downloading large files.</LI>
        <LI>Excessive use of regular expressions or strings while parsing files. </LI>
        <LI>Excessive ViewState.</LI>
        <LI>Too much data in session state or too many sessions.</LI>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Page Reads/sec is the rate at which the disk was read to resolve hard page faults. It shows the number of reads operations, without regard to the number of pages retrieved in each operation. Hard page faults occur when a process references a page in virtual memory that is not in working set or elsewhere in physical memory, and must be retrieved from disk. This counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays. It includes read operations to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) and in non-cached mapped memory files. Compare the value of Memory\\Pages Reads/sec to the value of Memory\\Pages Input/sec to determine the average number of pages read during each operation.]]></DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[RPC Average Latency is a server RPC latency in milliseconds averaged for the past 1024 packets.
<p>If the RPC Averaged Latency performance counter value is lower than 50 ms, the server can process the requests in a reasonable amount of time. If the counter value stays greater than 50 ms for more than several seconds, this indicates that the server is having difficulty keeping up with the load. As a result, users may experience delays when accessing their e-mail messages.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;the RPC Averaged Latency performance counter has stayed greater than&nbsp;50 ms for a sustained period,&nbsp;users may experience delays. Another symptom you may experience when this threshold is reached is a popup window on the Microsoft Outlook client stating that Outlook is retrieving data from the Microsoft Exchange server. This alert may be caused by increased remote procedure call (RPC) load, or a bottleneck in one or more resources.</p>
<p><strong>User Action:</strong><br />
To resolve this problem, determine the resources that are creating a bottleneck and attempt to mitigate the problem. Possible bottlenecks include disk reads or writes, processor time, available memory, and network configuration. <br />

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Database Cache Size is the amount of system memory used by the database cache manager to hold commonly used information from the database file(s) to prevent file operations.

If there is a lot of available memory on the system and the database cache size is not growing beyond a certain point, the database cache size may be capped at an artificially low limit.  Increasing this limit may increase performance.

Maximum value is RAM-2GB (RAM-3GB for servers with sync replication enabled). This and Database Cache Hit % are extremely useful counters for gauging whether a server's performance problems might be resolved by adding more physical memory.

Use this counter along with store private bytes to determine if there are store memory leaks.]]></DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Log Generation Checkpoint Depth represents the amount of work, in count of log files, that will need to be redone or undone to the database file(s) if the process crashes.<br>

<p>The Log Generation Checkpoint Depth performance counter reports the number of transaction log files that have not yet been saved to the database. This number represents the number of transaction log files that must be replayed to the database if the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service process (Store.exe) stops and needs to be restarted. As the log file generation depth increases, the Exchange Information Store startup time increases. If the transaction log file depth of a storage group reaches 5,000, the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) dismounts all the databases that are in the affected storage group.</p>
<p>This alert indicates that the checkpoint depth is greater than 2500. The transaction log file depth may grow during periods when the server is busy. However, large values typically occur when there is a failure or when a backup fails.</p>
<p><strong>User Action:</strong><br />
To resolve this error, do one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check if there is a failure, or if there is any application causing the Exchange Information Store to fail. Resolve the cause of the failure&nbsp;so that the checkpoint depth will start to decrease.</li>
    <li>Check if there is a backup process that has failed.</li>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[This counter indicates the percentage of time a thread runs in privileged mode. When your application calls operating system functions (for example to perform file or network I/O or to allocate memory), these operating system functions are executed in privileged mode.<BR>
<BR>
High privileged mode CPU indicates that computer is spending too much time in system I/O versus real (user mode) work. % Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode.  When a Windows system service in called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.<BR>
<BR>
This analysis checks to see if privileged mode CPU is consuming more than 30% of total CPU and the total CPU usage exceeds 50%. If so, then the CPU consumption is likely caused by another bottleneck other than the processor such as network, memory, or disk I/O.<BR>
