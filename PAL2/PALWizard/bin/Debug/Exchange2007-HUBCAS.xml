    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the processor spends to execute a non-Idle thread. It is calculated by measuring the duration of the idle thread is active in the sample interval, and subtracting that time from interval duration.  (Each processor has an idle thread that consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). This counter is the primary indicator of processor activity, and displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval. It is calculated by monitoring the time that the service is inactive, and subtracting that value from 100%.

This analysis checks for utilization greater than 60% on each individual processor. If so, determine if it is high user mode CPU or high privileged mode. If high privileged mode CPU is suspected, then see the Privileged Mode CPU Analysis. If a user-mode processor bottleneck is suspected, then consider using a process profiler to analyze the functions causing the high CPU consumption. See â€œHow To: Identify Functions causing a High User-mode CPU Bottleneck for Server Applications in a Production Environmentâ€ article in the references section for more information.<BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Bytes Total/sec is the rate at which bytes are sent and received over each network adapter, including framing characters. Network Interface\Bytes Received/sec is a sum of Network Interface\Bytes Received/sec and Network Interface\Bytes Sent/sec. This counter indicates the rate at which bytes are sent and received over each network adapter. This counter helps you know whether the traffic at your network adapter is saturated and if you need to add another network adapter. How quickly you can identify a problem depends on the type of network you have as well as whether you share bandwidth with other applications.<BR>
<BR>
This analysis converts Bytes Total/sec to bits and compares it to the current bandwidth of the network adapter to calculate network utilization. Next, it checks for utilization above 50%.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Processor Queue Length is the number of threads in the processor queue.  Unlike the disk counters, this counter counters, this counter shows ready threads only, not threads that are running.  There is a single queue for processor time even on computers with multiple processors. Therefore, if a computer has multiple processors, you need to divide this value by the number of processors servicing the workload. A sustained processor queue of less than 10 threads per processor is normally acceptable, dependent of the workload.<BR>
<BR>
This analysis determines if the average processor queue length exceeds the number of processors. If so, then this could indicate a processor bottleneck. Use this analysis in correlation with Privileged Mode CPU Analysis and â€œExcessive Processor Use by Processâ€ analysis.<BR>
<BR>
If there are more tasks ready to run than there are processors, threads queue up. The processor queue is the collection of threads that are ready but not able to be executed by the processor because another active thread is currently executing. A sustained or recurring queue of more threads than number of processors is a good indication of a processor bottleneck.<BR>
<BR>
You can use this counter in conjunction with the Processor\% Processor Time counter to determine if your application can benefit from more CPUs. There is a single queue for processor time, even on multiprocessor computers. Therefore, in a multiprocessor computer, divide the Processor Queue Length (PQL) value by the number of processors servicing the workload.<BR>
<BR>
If the CPU is very busy (90 percent and higher utilization) and the PQL average is consistently higher than the number of processors, then you may have a processor bottleneck that could benefit from additional CPUs. Or, you could reduce the number of threads and queue more at the application level. This will cause less context switching, and less context switching is good for reducing CPU load. The common reason for a high PQL with low CPU utilization is that requests for processor time arrive randomly and threads demand irregular amounts of time from the processor. This means that the processor is not a bottleneck but that it is your threading logic that needs to be improved.<BR>
<BR>
If a user-mode processor bottleneck is suspected, then consider using a process profiler to analyze the functions causing the high CPU consumption. See â€œHow To: Identify Functions causing a High User-mode CPU Bottleneck for Server Applications in a Production Environmentâ€ article in the references section for more information.<BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[This counter indicates the percentage of time a thread runs in privileged mode. When your application calls operating system functions (for example to perform file or network I/O or to allocate memory), these operating system functions are executed in privileged mode.<BR>
<BR>
High privileged mode CPU indicates that computer is spending too much time in system I/O versus real (user mode) work. % Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode.  When a Windows system service in called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.<BR>
<BR>
This analysis checks to see if privileged mode CPU is consuming more than 30% of total CPU and the total CPU usage exceeds 50%. If so, then the CPU consumption is likely caused by another bottleneck other than the processor such as network, memory, or disk I/O.<BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Pool Nonpaged Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the nonpaged pool, an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that cannot be written to disk, but must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.<BR>
<BR>
This analysis checks to see if the system is becoming close to the maximum Pool Nonpaged memory size. It does this by estimating the pool sizes taking into consideration /3GB, physical memory size, and 32-bit/64-bit, then determining if the value is higher than 60% of the estimated pool size. If the system becomes close to the maximum size, then the system could experience system wide hangs. Checks both 32-bit and 64-bit memory pools. Warning: The /3GB switch option in the boot.ini file significantly reduces the size of this memory pool.<BR>
<BR>
If the system is low on Paged Pool or non-Paged pool memory, then it is recommended to open a support case with Microsoft to address this. Alternatively, you can use a free and public tool called Poolmon.exe to see what DLLâ€™s are using kernel memory (see the article below). Most kernel memory leaks can be tracked back to a usermode process. To identify which user mode process is responsible, reboot the system (so you start off with a clean system), start a performance monitor log intending to run for a week or more capturing the Memory and Process objects, then analyze the perfmon log looking for memory leaks and/or handle leaks in one or more of the processes. In any case, migrating to a 64-bit version of Windows should alleviate this issue.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[This analysis checks to see if the system is becoming close to the maximum Pool paged memory size. Pool Paged Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the paged pool, an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used.<BR>
<BR>
This analysis checks to see if the system is becoming close to the maximum Pool Paged memory size. It does this by estimating the pool sizes taking into consideration /3GB, physical memory size, and 32-bit/64-bit, then determining if the value is higher than 60% of the estimated pool size. If the system becomes close to the maximum size, then the system could experience system wide hangs. Checks both 32-bit and 64-bit memory pools. Warning: The /3GB switch option in the boot.ini file significantly reduces the size of this memory pool.<BR>
<BR>
If the system is low on Paged Pool or non-Paged pool memory, then it is recommended to open a support case with Microsoft to address this. Alternatively, you can use a free and public tool called Poolmon.exe to see what DLLâ€™s are using kernel memory (see the article below). Most kernel memory leaks can be tracked back to a usermode process. To identify which user mode process is responsible, reboot the system (so you start off with a clean system), start a performance monitor log intending to run for a week or more capturing the Memory and Process objects, then analyze the perfmon log looking for memory leaks and/or handle leaks in one or more of the processes. In any case, migrating to a 64-bit version of Windows should alleviate this issue.<BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Available MBytes is the amount of physical memory available to processes running on the computer, in Megabytes, rather than bytes as reported in Memory\Available Bytes. The Virtual Memory Manager continually adjusts the space used in physical memory and on disk to maintain a minimum number of available bytes for the operating system and processes. When available bytes are plentiful, the Virtual Memory Manager lets the working sets of processes grow, or keeps them stable by removing an old page for each new page added. When available bytes are few, the Virtual Memory Manager must trim the working sets of processes to maintain the minimum required.

This analysis checks to see if the total available memory is low â€“ Warning at 10% available and Critical at 5% available. A Warning is also alerted when a decreasing trend of 10MBâ€™s per hour is detecting indicating a potential upcoming memory condition. Low physical memory can cause increased privileged mode CPU and system delays. <BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[This analysis checks to see if the Pages/sec is high. If it is high, then the system is likely running out of memory by trying to page the memory to the disk. Pages/sec is the rate at which pages are read from or written to disk to resolve hard page faults. This counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays.  It is the sum of Memory\Pages Input/sec and Memory\Pages Output/sec. It is counted in numbers of pages, so it can be compared to other counts of pages, such as Memory\Page Faults/sec, without conversion. It includes pages retrieved to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) non-cached mapped memory files.<BR>
<BR>
This counter should always be below 1000, therefore this analysis checks for values above 1000. Use this analysis in correlation with Available Memory Analysis and Memory Leak Analysis. All are throwing alerts at the same time, then this may indicate the system is running out of memory and the suspected processes involved and follow analysis steps mentioned in the Memory Leak analysis.<BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[High context switching is only a problem if privileged mode CPU and overall CPU is high as well. This analysis checks for high CPU, high privileged mode CPU, and high system context switches per sec.<BR>
<BR>
Threshold: As a general rule, context switching rates of less than 5,000 per second per processor are not worth worrying about. If context switching rates exceed 15,000 per second per processor, then there is a constraint.<BR>
<BR>
Significance: Context switching happens when a higher priority thread preempts a lower priority thread that is currently running or when a high priority thread blocks. High levels of context switching can occur when many threads share the same priority level. This often indicates that there are too many threads competing for the processors on the system. If you do not see much processor utilization and you see very low levels of context switching, it could indicate that threads are blocked.<BR>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[This analysis determines if any of the processes are consuming a large size of the system's memory and if the process is increasing in memory consumption over time. A process consuming large portions of memory is okay as long as the process returns the memory back to the system. Look for increasing trends in the chart. An increasing trend over a long period of time could indicate a memory leak. Private Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of memory that this process has allocated that cannot be shared with other processes. This analysis checks for a 10MBâ€™s per hour and 5MBâ€™s per hour increasing trends. Use this analysis in correlation with the Available Memory analysis.<BR>
<BR>
Also, keep in mind that newly started processes will initially appear as a memory leak when it is simply normal start up behavior. A memory leak is when a process continues to consume memory and not releasing memory over a long period of time.<BR>

<b>Hotfix:</b><br>
<br>
Applying <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938486">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938486</a> will help reduce the amount that the working sets are trimmed preventing server performance issues due to excessive paging. <b>Note:</b> Any driver that calls the function MMAllocateContiguousMemory in large blocks may cause working sets to get trimmed.

When a page is faulted, the system tries to read multiple contiguous pages into memory to maximize the benefit of the read operation. Compare the value of Memory\\Pages Input/sec to the value of  Memory\\Page Reads/sec to determine the average number of pages read into memory during each read operation.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[
      The total number of managed exceptions thrown per second. As this number increases, performance degrades. Exceptions should not be thrown as part of normal processing. Note, however, that Response.Redirect, Server.Transfer, and Response.End all cause a ThreadAbortException to be thrown multiple times, and a site that relies heavily upon these methods will incur a performance penalty. If you must use Response.Redirect, call Response.Redirect(url, false), which does not call Response.End, and hence does not throw. The downside is that the user code that follows the call to Response.Redirect(url, false) will execute. It is also possible to use a static HTML page to redirect. Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 312629 provides further detail. In addition to monitoring this very useful performance counter, the Application_Error event should be used in order to alert administrators to problems.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[
      The number of bytes committed by managed objects. This is the sum of the large object heap and the generation 0, 1, and 2 heaps. These regions of memory are of type MEM_COMMIT (see Platform SDK documentation for VirtualAlloc). The value of this counter will always be less than the value of Process\Private Bytes, which counts all MEM_COMMIT regions for the process. Private Bytes minus # Bytes in all Heaps is the number of bytes committed by unmanaged objects. The first step in the investigation of excessive memory usage is to determine whether it is being used by managed or unmanaged objects. To investigate excessive managed memory usage, I recommend WINDBG.EXE and SOS.DLL, which you can read about in Production Debugging for .NET Framework Applications. SOS.DLL has a "!dumpheap â€“stat" command that lists the count, size, and type of objects in the managed heap. You can use "!dumpheap â€“mt" to obtain the address of an object, and "!gcroot" to see its roots. The command "!eeheap" presents memory usage statistics for the managed heaps. 
      <P>
      Another useful tool for diagnosing memory usage is the CLR Profiler, discussed in more detail below. 
      <P>
      Excessive managed memory usage is commonly caused by: 
      <OL type="a">
        <LI>Reading large data sets into memory.</LI>
        <LI>Creating excessive cache entries.</LI>
        <LI>Uploading or downloading large files.</LI>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Retry Mailbox Delivery Queue Length is the number of items in retry in the retry mailbox queues.
<p>The Retry Mailbox Delivery Queue Length performance counter measures the number of messages currently in the retry mailbox delivery queue. Messages in this queue are in a retry state because an issue prevented their delivery. If the issue is transient, a subsequent attempt to send the message may be successful.</p>
<p>Messages that cannot be successfully delivered are subject to various retry, resubmit, and expiration deadlines based on the message's source and destination. Retry is a renewed connection attempt with the destination domain, smart host, or Mailbox server. Resubmit is the act of sending messages back to the Submission queue for the categorizer to reprocess. The message is said to &quot;time-out&quot;, or expire, after all delivery efforts have failed during a specified period of time. After a message expires, the sender is notified of the delivery failure. Then the message is deleted from the queue.</p>
<p>In all three cases of retry, resubmit, or expire, you can manually intervene before the automatic actions are performed on the messages.</p>
<p>This problem may be caused by any of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A domain that you send a large amount of e-mail to is down or experiencing problems.</li>
    <li>A computer on your network may be infected with a virus which is sending messages through your Exchange servers.</li>
    <li>Your DNS server may have some issue resolving fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to IP addresses.</li>
    <li>There may be a network connectivity issue that is preventing your server from properly connecting to destination servers or the Internet. Some possible issues that could effect your connection are:</li>
    <li>Router or routing issues between your server and the destination.</li>
    <li>Proxy or gateway server issues.</li>
    <li>Internet Service providers (ISP) issues such as a cut line, downed system, routing issues, global disturbance, or some other issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Determine the root cause of the issue by doing one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check the destination where the retry messages are being sent to. If the messages are all addressed to a single domain, or small number of domains, verify that the specified domains are valid and functional using the steps detailed in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-za/library/bb123686(en-us).aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-za/library/bb123686(en-us).aspx</a>.</li>
    <li>Verify that there are no computers on your network that are infected with a virus which is sending messages through your Exchange server(s). Check where the retry messages are being sent to, if there a large number of messages addressed to companies that you do not know or do not regularly work with, or with unusual subject lines that look to be spam in nature. Take steps to remove the virus from the infected computer, or remove the computer from your network.</li>
    <li>Confirm that your DNS server can resolve the FQDNs of the affected domain's mail exchanger (MX) resource records to IP by using the NSLOOKUP command as described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc740171.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc740171.aspx</a>.</li>
    <li>Confirm that there are no network connectivity issues preventing your server from properly connecting to destination servers or the Internet. After you have isolated and corrected the issue, manually submit again any messages that are located in the mailbox delivery queues. To do this, use either the Queue Viewer or the Retry-Queue cmdlet and specify the Resubmit parameter. For information about how to retry sending a message, see <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-za/library/bb124568(en-us).aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-za/library/bb124568(en-us).aspx</a>.</li>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Submission Queue Length is the number of items in the submission queue.
<p>The Submission Queue Length performance counter measures the number of messages currently in the submission queue. Messages in this queue are in a retry state because an issue prevented their submission to the categorizer. The categorizer is responsible for doing things such as querying the Active Directory domain controllers in order to determine where the recipient of the message resides or determining the members of a distribution group. It is also responsible for running transport agents and rules and determining the optimal path a message should take. If the issue is transient, a subsequent attempt to submit the message may be successful.</p>
<p>A sustained high Submission Queue Length value may indicate that an excessive amount of inbound messages have over-loaded the categorizer. It may also indicate that there is an issue with message categorization. Message resubmission sends undelivered messages back to the submission queue to be processed again by the categorizer.</p>
<p>A sustained high Submission Queue Length may be caused by one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The server is being over-utilized and does not have enough resources to satisfy all of the current requests. This situation may occur if there are more messages being submitted for transport then the server can handle. Similarly, it may also occur if many messages are being resubmitted for categorization.</li>
    <li>There is a problem with a custom transport agent or rule, or a third-party transport agent or rule.</li>
    <li>Or there is an issue querying an Active Directory domain controller either due to permission or network related issues or the domain controller may be experiencing performance issues of its own.</li>

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Unreachable Queue Length is the number of items in the unreachable queues.
<p>The categorizer sends messages to the unreachable queue when there is no known route to their destinations. Typically, an unreachable destination is caused by a configuration error that affects the delivery path. For example, the messages will be sent to the unreachable queue if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are messages in the &quot;Contoso.com&quot; remote delivery queue.</li>
    <li>You delete the Send connector that is used to reach the Contoso.com domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the messages in the unreachable queue have the status of Ready. Messages remain in the unreachable queue until they are manually resubmitted by an administrator, removed by an administrator, an Active Directory Exchange topology configuration change is detected or the value specified in the MessageExpirationTimeOut parameter passes.</p>
<p>To resolve this problem, determine what messages are in the queue and then determine their destination. Using this information correct any configuration issues and ensure that a delivery path exists for these messages. Finally, resubmit the messages in the unreachable message queue. You can do this by using Exchange Queue Viewer or by running the Resume-Message cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell.</p>]]></DESCRIPTION>

      The number of milliseconds taken to execute the last request. In version 1.0 of the Framework, the execution time begins when the worker process receives the request, and stops when the ASP.NET ISAPI sends HSE_REQ_DONE_WITH_SESSION to IIS. For IIS version 5, this includes the time taken to write the response to the client, but for IIS version 6, the response buffers are sent asynchronously, and so the time taken to write the response to the client is not included. Thus on IIS version 5, a client with a slow network connection will increase the value of this counter considerably. In version 1.1 of the Framework, execution time begins when the HttpContext for the request is created, and stops before the response is sent to IIS. Assuming that user code does not call HttpResponse.Flush, this implies that execution time stops before sending any bytes to IIS, or to the client for that matter. ASP.NET\Request Execution Time is an instance counter, and very volatile. On the other hand, time to last byte (TTLB) can be easily averaged and used to calculate a better estimate of performance over a period of time. TTLB can be calculated through a simple HTTP client written in managed code, or you can use one of the many HTTP clients available that calculate TTLB, such as Application Center Test (ACT). Note that if <compilation debug=/> is set to TRUE, then batch compilation will be disabled and the <httpRuntime executionTimeout=/> configuration setting as well as calls to Server.ScriptTimeout will be ignored. This can cause problems if the <processModel responseDeadlockInterval=/> setting is not set to Infinite, since requests for debug pages can theoretically run forever. Threshold: N.A. The value of this counter should be stable. Experience will help set a threshold for a particular site. When the process model is enabled, the request execution time includes the time required to write the response to the client, and therefore depends upon the bandwidth of the client's connection.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[
      The number of requests currently queued. When running on IIS 5.0, there is a queue between inetinfo and aspnet_wp, and there is one queue for each virtual directory. When running on IIS 6.0, there is a queue where requests are posted to the managed ThreadPool from native code, and a queue for each virtual directory. This counter includes requests in all queues. The queue between inetinfo and aspnet_wp is a named pipe through which the request is sent from one process to the other. The number of requests in this queue increases if there is a shortage of available I/O threads in the aspnet_wp process. On IIS 6.0 it increases when there are incoming requests and a shortage of worker threads. Note that requests are rejected when the Requests Current counter exceeds the <processModel requestQueueLimit=/>. Many people think this occurs when the Requests Queued counter exceeds requestQueueLimit, but this is not the case. When this limit is exceeded, requests will be rejected with a 503 status code and the message "Server is too busy." If a request is rejected for this reason, it will never reach managed code, and error handlers will not be notified. Normally this is only an issue when the server is under a very heavy load, although a "burst" load every hour might also cause this. For the unusual burst load scenario, you might be interested in the hotfix described in Knowledge Base Article 810259, which will allow you to increase the minimum number of I/O threads from the default of 1 per CPU. Each virtual directory has a queue that it uses to maintain the availability of worker and I/O threads. The number of requests in this queue increases if the number of available worker threads or available I/O threads falls below the limit specified by <httpRuntime minFreeThreads=/>. When the limit specified by <httpRuntime appRequestQueueLimit=/> is exceeded, the request is rejected with a 503 status code and the client receives an HttpException with the message "Server too busy." By itself, this counter is not a clear indicator of performance issues, nor can it be used to determine when requests will be rejected. In Knowledge Base Article 329959, two new performance counters were introduced to address this problem: Requests Current and Requests In Application Queue. Please see the descriptions for these two counters, as well as for Requests Rejected.
