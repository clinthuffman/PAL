    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>\Process % Privileged Time / Process(sqlservr)\% Privileged Time</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Description:</B> % Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode. When a Windows system service is called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.
<BR><BR>
Privileged or kernel mode is the processing mode that allows code to have direct access to all hardware and memory in the system. I/O operations and other system services run in privileged (kernel) mode; user applications run in user mode. Unless the processes are graphics-intensive or I/O-intensive such as file and print services, most applications should not be processing much work in kernel mode.
Privileged mode corresponds to the percentage of time the processor spends on execution of Microsoft Windows kernel commands, such as processing of SQL Server I/O requests. If this counter is consistently high when the Physical Disk counters are high, consider focusing on improving the disk subsystem.
<BR>
It is recommended to look for comparitive trends with other processes, work loads, error counts, and other behaviors to find what is driving Privileged Time.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> Different disk controllers and drivers use different amounts of kernel processing time. Efficient controllers and drivers use less privileged time, leaving more processing time available for user applications, increasing overall throughput.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Threshold:</B>
<BR>
<B>Yellow:</B> SQL Server is using more than 20% Privileged (kernel) mode CPU usage
<BR><B>Red:</B> SQL Server is using more than 30% Privileged (kernel) mode CPU usage
<BR><BR><B>Next Steps:</B>
The key piece to diagnosing high processor conditions is to determine the ratio of privileged mode to user mode CPU.
The counter '\Processor\% Processor Time' is the sum of '\Processor\% Privileged Time' and '\Processor\% User Time'. If Privileged Time is pushing the %Processor Time higher then it is due to processes executing in kernel mode. If '% User Time' is causing the % Processor Time to be higher then it is likely a user mode process that is causing the pressure.
If %Privileged Time is consistently high or shows high under load, it could be several issues. The most common reason for high %Privileged Time is disk pressure which can be measured by correlating this counter with Physical Disk reads / sec and Physical Disk writes / sec. If these are also high you may also see a high number of Page Latch Waits for SQL Server which can be measured by examining the sys.dm_os_wait_stats dynamic management view and the perfmon SQL Server:Wait Statistics perfmon counters. 
<BR>
If SQL Server Memory Manager: Page Life Expectancy is also low try to address by reducing the number of queries that are performing a high number of logical reads by adding indexes, ensuring that statistics are up to date, and potentially rewriting the query. 
<BR>
You could add more physical RAM to help raise Page Life Expectancy if it is low (lower than your baseline, or critical when under 300) although we only recommend adding memory as an absolute last resort. We first recommended addressing design and addressing poor indexing first. Adding physical RAM only masks the real issue.
<BR>
The other potential reasons for high privileged mode are related to out of date drivers, BIOS being out of date, failing components, processes that run in kernel mode such as anti-virus, and other potential issues.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>SQLServer:Access Methods Forwarded Records/sec</B>
<BR>
<BR><B>Description:</B> Rows with varchar columns on tables without a clustered index can experience expansion when varchar values are updated with a longer string.  In the case where the row cannot fit in the existing page, the row migrates and access to the row will traverse a pointer.  
Forwarded records occur when a data record in a heap increases in size and the record's current page does not have the space to store the size increase. The record is moved to a new location, becoming a forwarded record, and the forwarding record is left in the original location to point to the real location of the record. The forwarded record points back to the forwarding record in case its location ever needs to change again.
Access Methods Forwarded Records/sec measures the number of records accessed through forwarded record pointers which are due to tables without a clustered index. A forwarded record is basically a pointer. For instance, if you start with a short row, and update the row creating a wider row, the row might not fit on the data page. A pointer is put in its location and the row is forwarded to another page. Forwarding Records are used as a performance optimization so that all the non-clustered indexes on the heap do not have to be altered with the new location of the heap record.
If a table has lots of forwarded records, scanning the table can be very inefficient.
Also, rows with varchar columns can experience expansion when varchar values are updated with a longer string. In the case where the row cannot fit in the existing page, the row migrates and access to the row will traverse a pointer. 
Forwarded Records only occurs on heaps which are tables without clustered indexes. 
<BR><B>Threshold:</B> (Yellow) - This value should not be greater than 10% of the number of Batch Requests/Sec
<BR><B>Next Steps:</B>
<BR>Look at code to determine where the short row is inserted followed by an update. <BR><B>Forwarded records can be avoided by:</B>
<BR><LI>Evaluate clustered indexes for heap tables.
<LI>Using default values so that an update does not result in a longer row that is the root cause of forwarded records.
<LI>Using Char instead of Varchar. Using Char creates a fixed length so that an update does not result in a longer row. 
<LI>In cases where clustered indexes cannot be used, drop non-clustered indexes, build a clustered index to reorganize pages and rows, drop the clustered index, and then recreate non-clustered indexes. In SQL Server 2008 and above, you can use ALTER TABLE ... REBUILD to remove heap fragmentation.
Note that if a table has one or more non-clustered indexes, these have to be rebuilt when moving from a heap to a clustered table or vice-versa.
<LI>Learn to use the sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats dynamic management view (DMV) to find forwarded records. In the sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats DMV there is a column used called the forwarded_record_count which counts the number of records in a heap that have forward pointers to another data location. (This state occurs during an update, when there is not enough room to store the new row in the original location.)

<BR>
<BR><B>Description:</B>
<BR>This counter represents inserts into a table with no physical ordering of the rows. A table with no ordering, without a clustered index, is known as a heap table. Inserts into heaps will require SQL Server to perform freespace scans to identify pages with free space to insert rows. A heap table also requires an additional, internal column called an uniquifier to be generated for each row inserted. 
Extra processing is required to define and store a heap table since SQL Server normally uses the clustered index as a storage mechanism for the table data. Freespace scans have an additional I/O expense for inserts and can possibly cause contention on the GAM, SGAM, and PFS pages when there are many connections inserting. 
It is usually recommended that you physically order the table rows by using a clustered index on the table.
FreeSpace Scans/sec represents inserts into a table with no physical ordering of its rows which is called a heap. A heap table requires an additional column called an uniquifier to be generated for each row inserted. It is recommended that you physically order the table rows by using a clustered on the table for most tables.

***Also, a heap table requires an additional column called an uniquifier to be generated for each row inserted. It is usually recommended that you physically order the table rows by using a clustered on the table for most tables.

FreeSpace Scans/sec measures the number of scans per second that were initiated to search for free space within pages already allocated to an allocation unit to insert or modify record fragments. Each scan may find multiple pages. FreeSpace Scans are due to inserts into heaps that require SQL Server to perform freespace scans to identify pages with free space to insert rows. Freespace scans are an additional I/O expense for inserts and can possibly cause contention on the GAM, SGAM, and PFS pages when many spids are inserting. The solution is often to add a clustered index for base tables.
One or more of the following symptoms may accompany poor performance during inserts to a large table on SQL Server: 
<BR>
<LI>Unexplained high CPU usage by SQL Server, sometimes up to 100%.
<LI>SQL Profiler or SHOWPLAN indicates that singleton inserts have wide variations in performance.
<LI>The number of reads is out of proportion to the number or size of the indexes and triggers on the table.
<LI>Sporadic timeouts.
<LI>The FreeSpace Scans/Sec counter from the SQL Server:Access Methods object in Performance Monitor is excessively high given all the factors involved in your specific environment. 
A common cause for these symptoms is that inserts to a heap (a table without a clustered index) are often slower than inserts to a table with a clustered index (a clustered table).

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>SQLServer:Access Methods Full Scans/sec</B>
<BR><B>Description:</B> This counter monitors the number of full scans on base tables or indexes. High values indicate that we may be having performance issues due to table / index page scans. If we see high CPU and / or drops in Page Life Expectancy (PLE) then we need to investigate this counter; however, if full scans are on small tables we can safely ignore this counter as this counter tracks all full table scans, not just those on large tables. A few of the main causes of high Full Scans/sec are missing indexes, too many rows requested, queries with missing indexes, or too many rows requested will have a large number of logical reads and an increased CPU time.
<BR>
This analysis throws a Warning alert if the ratio of Index Searches/sec to Full Scans/sec is less than 1000 to 1 and if there are more than 1000 Index Searches/sec.
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> This counter monitors the number of full scans on tables or indexes. This counter can be ignored unless there is also poor disk performance, and / or, high CPU use along with high scan rates. High scan rates may be caused by missing indexes, very small tables, or requests for too many records. 
<BR><B>Next Steps:</B>
The main causes of high Full Scans/sec are:
<LI>Missing indexes
<LI>Too many rows requested queries with missing indexes or too many rows requested will have a large number of logical reads (disk impact) and an increased CPU time. As mentioned, if there is a high level of Full Scans to Index Searches, then it is important to also check the following:
See PERFMON SQLServer:Buffer Manager performance counters for memory pressure:
<LI>Page Life Expectancy
<LI>Checkpoint pages/sec
<LI>Lazy writes/sec
A high number of scans can cause buffer pool pressure (as indicated with low PLE and a higher Lazy Writes / sec count).
Memory pressure will quickly manifest into disk pressure, so also check:
See PERFMON Physical Disk performance counters: 
<LI>Disk sec/read
<LI>Disk sec/write
<BR><B>Note:</B> Identify disk bottlenecks by using Performance Counters, Profiler, sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats and SHOWPLAN output.
Also refer to the sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats dynamic management view (DMV) to track io_stalls to help identify IO bottlenecks. 
To back up and support this information, compare the counters to sys.dm_os_wait_stats output. If you see high values in perfmon, you may also see high waits for the following:
<LI>ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION
<LI>IO_COMPLETION
<LI>PAGEIOLATCH_* (Data page I/O completion waits appear as PAGEIOLATCH_* waits)
Reactively, SQL Profiler can be used to identify which SQL statements are causing scans. Use the scans event class and events scan:started and scan:completed. Include the object ID data column. Save the profiler trace to a file and then convert it to trace table. You can then search for the scans event. 
The scan:completed event provides the associated IO so that you can also search for high reads, writes, and duration.

<BR>
<B>Description:</B> The number of page splits per second that occurs as the result of overflowing index pages and new page allocations. When a record is inserted into an index, it must be inserted in order. If the data page is full, the page splits in order to maintain the appropriate order. A high value for this counter may warrant the consideration of a lower fill factor and pad_index to leave more empty space per page.
This value should be as low as possible. Heavily fragmented indexes may be the result of high page splits/sec.
<BR><B>Note:</B> A high value for this counter is not bad in situations where many new pages are being created, since it includes all new page allocations as well as splits when a data page spilts.
<BR><B>Threshold:</B>
<BR>Yellow: A ratio of more than 1 page split for every 20 batch requests
<BR><B>Next Steps:</B>
If the number of page splits is high, consider increasing the fillfactor of your indexes. An increased fillfactor helps to reduce page splits by increasing the amount of free space on each page.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>\SQLServer:Access Methods\Scan Point Revalidations/sec</B>
<BR>
<B>Description:</B> Scan Point Revalidations occurs during range scans. When a range scan occurs there is an optimization process that occurs where the pages are marked as satisfied with the WHERE predicate that does the range scan. 
Instead of scanning through each and every row in the page, it does not keep an exclusive lock on those pages; instead it just keeps a mark on it and continues with rest of the scan. If one or more rows in the page are modified by update or a delete operation, the update or delete process will notify the scan to recheck the page to see if the page is still valid for the range scan. This recheck is called a Scan Point Revalidation.
Scan Point Revalidations shows the contention between range scans and modifications to the same pages. This counter also pinpoints hotspots within the cluster table competing between reads and writes.
Scan Point Revalidations are the number of times per second that the scan point had to be revalidated before the scan could be continued. If a page latch has to be released due to contention, the scan point must be revalidated when the scan resumes. 
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> This is an informative counter. It is not a critical counter that should be used for baselines or alerting.
<BR><B>Next Steps:</B> You can correlate the Scan Count Revalidations/sec with the Range Scans/sec counter and Page Latch related counters. The higher the number of range scans on the same pages, the higher the number of scan point revalidations.
High number of Scan Point Revalidations/sec potentially indicate hot spots in the data, probably due to a poor choice of clustered index putting the most active rows on the same page.
Consider reducing the number of range scans, isolating reporting and application use, and most importantly ensuring that the clustered index choice is the right one. Clustered indexes should be on columns that are sorted on, grouped on, used in joins, used in between queries, and in other operations where the order of the returned data is critical.

<B>Description: </B>
Number of Workfiles created in the last second. Workfiles in TempDB are used in processing hash operations when the amount of data being processed is too big to fit into the available memory. The Work files are similar to work tables but are created strictly by hashing operations. Workfiles are used to store temporary results for hash joins and hash aggregates.<BR>
Hash joins can require large amounts of memory for execution. As part of executing a hash join, the memory required for the hash can become too large and require a spill to disk. The disk storage to backup the hash operation is called a workfile. Workfiles are collections of extents and pages that are managed strictly by the workfile code.
<BR>
<B>Threshold: </B>
<BR>Yellow: Greater than 20 Workfiles created per second
<BR>
<B>Next Steps:</B> 
Make queries more efficient by adding/changing indexes. Run expensive queries through the Database Tuning Advisor (DTA), look for expensive queries and consider rewriting them, and add as last resort consider adding additional memory.

<BR><B>Description:</B> Number of worktables created in the last second. The number of work tables created per second. Work tables are temporary objects and are used to store results for query spool, LOB variables, and cursors.

<BR><B>Threshold:</B>
<BR>Yellow: Greater than 20 Worktables created per second. This will need to be baselined for accuracy.
<BR><B>Next Steps:</B><BR> Look for expensive statements with high CPU, duration, and statements that run in parallel and tune them by adding indexes, reducing the volume of data being returned, and adding indexes where appropriate.
Ensure that TempDB is not a bottleneck and is following best practices.
If you determine that the throughput of your application has degraded because of contention in allocation structures, you can use the following techniques to minimize it.
Evaluate your application and the query plans to see if you can minimize the creation of work tables and temporary tables. Monitor the perfmon counters as described in Monitoring contention caused by DML operations. Then, use SQL Profiler to correlate the values of these counters with the currently running queries. This helps you identify the queries that are causing the contention in allocation structures. 
Divide TempDB into multiple data files of equal size. These multiple files don't necessarily need to be on different disks/spindles unless you are also encountering I/O bottlenecks as well. The general recommendation is to have one file per CPU because only one thread is active per CPU at one time. SQL Server allocates pages for TempDB objects in a round-robin fashion (also referred to as proportional fill) so that the latches on PFS and SGAM pages are distributed among multiple files. This is supported both in SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005. There are improvements to the proportional fill algorithm in SQL Server 2005.
Use TF-1118. Under this trace flag SQL Server allocates full extents to each TempDB object, thereby eliminating the contention on SGAM page. This is done at the expense of some waste of disk space in TempDB. This trace flag has been available since SQL Server 2000. With improvements in TempDB object caching since SQL Server 2005, there should be significantly less contention in allocation structures. If you see contention in SGAM pages, you may want to use this trace flag. Cached TempDB objects may not always be available. For example, cached TempDB objects are destroyed when the query plan with which they are associated is recompiled or removed from the procedure cache.
<BR>
<B>Note:</B>For each release of SQL Server, TempDB has more potential uses such as with SNAPSHOT ISOLATION level, temporary statistics use for read-only databases in SQL Server 2012 and more. It is recommended to keep a close watch on the usage of TempDB and leverage the TF1118 if the data file and sizing best practices do not address allocation bottlenecks.
<BR>
Additionally consider putting TempDB on local SSD disks in order to maximize disk performance.

<BR><BR><B>Description:</B> The Buffer Cache Hit Ratio measures the percentage of pages that were found in the buffer pool without having to incur a read from disk. This counter indicates how often SQL Server goes to the buffer, not the hard disk, to get data. The higher this ratio, the better. A high ratio, close to 100% indicates that SQL Server did not have to go to the hard disk often to fetch data, and performance overall is boosted. If the Buffer Cache Hit Ratio was 100% that would suggest that all of the pages are being accessed from cache and does not require trips to disk, because of the optimistic read ahead mechanism, this is not exactly the case.
When a user session wants to read data from the database, it will read directly from the SQL Server buffer cache (a logical read), or, if the buffer cache does not have the data that is requested, the data will be read into the buffer cache from disk (a physical read) and then from the buffer cache. If the requested data is in the buffer cache, then it is called a 'buffer hit'. If the data is not in the buffer cache it is called a 'buffer miss'. The ratio of buffer hits to total buffer requests is called the buffer cache hit ratio as can be seen from the following:
<BR><BR><B>Cache Hit Ratio = (Logical Reads - Physical Reads)/Logical Reads</B><BR>
<BR>A read from memory takes approximately 100 nanoseconds, while a read from disk takes about 8 milliseconds or more.
1 millisecond = 1,000,000 nanoseconds
The important point about SQL Server read operations is that when selecting data from the database, the user will wait on the complete read operation including all of the physical reads. The time is takes to select from the database depends on how much data will be read and how long it takes for those reads to occur. Even with cache reads, the time it takes to read a large amount of data can be significant. With physical reads, the time will be even longer.
There are a few considerations to be aware of regarding the Buffer Cache Hit Ratio counter. First, unlike many of the other counters available for monitoring SQL Server, this counter averages the Buffer Cache Hit Ratio from the time the instance of SQL Server was started. In other words, this counter is not a real-time measurement, but an average. Secondly, the buffer cache hit ratio may be skewed by the read ahead mechanism. Read Ahead Reads are pages that were read into cache while the query was processed. Read aheads are an optimistic form of physical reads. Because of the read ahead mechanism, you should not infer from a high buffer cache hit ratio that SQL Server is not suffering from memory pressure or at least could not benefit from additional memory.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>\SQLServer:Buffer Manager\Lazy writes/sec</B>
<BR><BR><B>Description:</B>
The Lazy Writes/sec counter records the number of buffers written each second by the buffer manager's lazy write process. This counter tracks how many times a second that the Lazy Writer process is moving dirty pages from the buffer to disk in order to free up buffer space. This process is where the dirty, aged buffers are removed from the buffer by a system process that frees the memory up for other uses. A dirty, aged buffer is one that has changes and needs to be written to the disk. High value on this counter possibly indicates I/O issues or even SQL Server memory problems. The Lazy writes / sec values should consistently be less than 20 for the average system.
Generally speaking, this should not be a high value, say more than 20 per second or so.  Ideally, it should be close to zero. If it is zero, this indicates that your SQL Server's buffer cache is plenty big and SQL Server doesn't have to free up dirty pages, instead waiting for this to occur during regular checkpoints. If this value is high, then a need for more memory is indicated.
<BR>

<B>Note:</B> NUMA will increase the number of lazy writer threads per NUMA node and influence the behavior of the lazy writer by increasing its execution at this view. If the server is a NUMA environment other signs of memory pressure should be used and you should analyze the Buffer Node counters for Page Life Expectancy per node. There is not a lazy writer counter in Buffer Nodes.
<BR>
<B>Threshold: </B>

<B>Next Steps:</B>
Look for an increase in SQL Server: Buffer Manager: Checkpoint Pages/sec and SQL Server:Buffer Manager: Lazy Writes/sec performance object counters because since SQL Server 2005 starts to flush pages out of the buffer pool cache under memory pressure.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>SQLServer_Buffer Manager Page Life Expectancy</B>
<BR><BR>
<B>Description:</B>
Number of seconds a page will stay in the buffer pool without references. This performance monitor counter tells you, on average, how long data pages are staying in the buffer. Any large drops of 30% or more should be investigated. Below 600 should be monitored and very low values near zero are considered a critical state. For monitoring, we are alerting at a warning level at 600 and a critical state of lower than 300 seconds, though getting a baseline is the best approach.
<BR>
When page life expectancy gets too low, this is an indication that SQL Server is doing too many logical reads putting pressure on the buffer pool. It is recommended to correlate page life expectancy with lazy writer activity. When page life expectancy becomes low, then SQL Server will respond by sweeping through the buffer pool using the lazy writer, increasing lazy writer activity. Low page life expectancy may cause more physical reads increasing pressure on disk and slowing down SQL Server responsiveness.
<BR>
The Page life expectancy counter is considered one of the most critical counters for SQL Server. If Page life expectancy becomes low SQL Server will attempt physical reads from disk into the buffer pool to honor requests. Requests from physical disk will take considerably longer causing higher disk costs. 
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> NUMA systems will have a CPU and memory grouping per node. If the server is a NUMA environment you should analyze the Buffer Node counters for Page Life Expectancy per node. You can tell a server is a NUMA system by checking the SQL Server error log or by querying sys.dm_os_memory_nodes. A non-NUMA system will have 2 nodes listed, A NUMA system will have additional nodes for each of the hardware NUMA nodes in the system.
<BR><B>Threshold:</B>
<BR><B>Yellow:</B> Page life expectancy is less than 10 minutes (600 seconds)
<BR><B>Red:</B> Page life expectancy is less than 5 minutes (300 seconds)

<BR><B>Next Steps:</B><BR>
If Buffer Manager\Page life expectancy is low then the Buffer Manager\Lazy Writes /sec will be higher as the Lazy Writer will become active attempting to free the buffer cache as SQL Server will be under memory pressure.
Due to the disk impact of the physical reads incurred, the \Physical Disk \Avg. Disk sec/Read counter may also become a bottleneck as SQL Server is reading from disk instead of the buffer pull to honor requests.
Look for an increase in SQL Server: Buffer Manager: Checkpoint Pages/sec and SQL Server:Buffer Manager: Lazy Writes/sec performance object counters because since SQL Server 2005 / 2008 starts to flush pages out of the buffer pool cache under memory pressure.
Run expensive queries through the Database Tuning Advisor (DTA), look for queries with a high number of logical reads and consider tuning and potentially rewriting them, and potentially add additional memory if non-hardware options to not address the issue.

<BR><B>Description:</B><BR>
Number of requests to find a page in the buffer pool. When the ratio of page lookups to batch requests is greater than 100, this is an indication that while query plans are looking up data in the buffer pool, these plans are inefficient or there was a large number of ad-hoc queries.

<BR>
<B>Threshold:</B> 
Ratio of Page Lookups/sec to Batch Requests/sec < 100 to 1.
<BR><B>Warning:</B> Page life expectancy is less than 5 minutes (300 seconds)
<BR><B>Next Steps:</B>
Page Lookups/sec is the number of requests to find a page in the buffer pool made per second. If this number is high as compared to the number of batch requests, this indicates a degree of inefficiency and a potential opportunity for tuning.
Identify queries with the highest amount of logical I/O's and tune them. 
<BR><B>Note:</B> You can track the Page Lookups/sec and other counters through the sys.dm_os_performance_counters DMV which contains all the SQL Server instance object-related counters that you can find in perfmon.

  <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>SQLServer_General Statistics Logins_sec</B>
<BR><BR><B>Description:</B> 
<BR>Login and logout rates should be approximately the same. A login rate higher than the logout rate suggests that the server is not in a steady state, or that applications are not correctly using connection pooling. This could result in an increased load on the server.
<BR><B>Next Steps:</B> 
<BR>Verify if the .NET connection string is using the pooling=true e connection reset=true parameters. 
If so, a profiler trace with the Audit login and Audit logout Events would reveal the usage of sp_reset_connection stored procedure, which is used by SQL Server to support remote stored procedure calls in a transaction. 
This stored procedure also causes Audit Login and Audit Logout events to fire when a connection is reused from a connection pool.
Also, the EventSubClass column in the trace will show if the connections are being pooled or not. 
Therefore focus the comparison only on the rate of non-pooled Logins and Logouts, as pooled connections will be reflected in the Logins/sec counter, but not on the Logouts/sec counter.

<BR><B>Description:</B> Current number of processes waiting for a workspace memory grant. Memory Grants Pending records the number of connections that are waiting for memory before they can begin processing a memory intensive query such as a sort or hash operation.  Connections that wait in this state for a long enough time will eventually receive an 8645 error (A time out occurred while waiting for memory resources to execute the query. Rerun the query).  A spid waiting in this state will have a waittype of 0x0040 (RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE) in sysprocesses.  If this counter remains above zero for any significant amount of time then you will need to track down what queries are doing sorts/hashes and run them through Database Tuning Advisor (DTA) to see if they can get a more efficient plan.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>SQLServer:SQL Statistics Batch Requests/sec</B>
<BR>
<B>Description</B> Number of SQL batch requests received by server. This counter measures the number of batch requests that SQL Server receives per second, and generally follows in step to how busy your server's CPUs are. Generally speaking, over 1000 batch requests per second indicates a very busy SQL Server, and could mean that if you are not already experiencing a CPU bottleneck, that you may very well soon. Of course, this is a relative number, and the bigger your hardware, the more batch requests per second SQL Server can handle. From a network bottleneck approach, a typical 100Mbs network card is only able to handle about 3000 batch requests per second. If you have a server that is this busy, you may need to have two or more network cards, or go to a 1Gbs network card. 

Note: Sometimes low batch requests/sec can be misleading.  If there were a SQL statements/sec counter, this would be a more accurate measure of the amount of SQL Server activity.  For example, an application may call only a few stored procedures yet each stored procedure does lot of work.  In that case, we will see a low number for batch requests/sec but each stored procedure (one batch) will execute many SQL statements that drive CPU and other resources.  As a result, many counter thresholds based on the number of batch requests/sec will seem to identify issues because the batch requests on such a server are unusually low for the level of activity on the server.  

We cannot conclude that a SQL Server is not active simply by looking at only batch requests/sec.  Rather, you have to do more investigation before deciding there is no load on the server.  If the average number of batch requests/sec is below 5 and other counters (such as SQL Server processor utilization) confirm the absence of significant activity, then there is not enough of a load to make any recommendations or identify issues regarding scalability.
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> Batch requests / sec is a great counter to use for baselining and to use as a measurement of how many batches the system could handle before a sympton was evident or a particular condition occured. This counter will greatly depend on SQL Server code and the hardware being used. It is often used as a gauge of saying that a particular system was able to handle x number of batch requests per second and then to examine system and SQL Server counters to determine what resource is the bottlneck at that particular workload.]]></DESCRIPTION>

<B>Description:</B> Number of SQL compilations that occured per second that includes recompiles. A high value subtracting recompiles can be an indication of a large number of ad hoc queries that can also be cross referenced with the number of ad hoc plans in the plan cache counter. 
<BR>
Be aware of the following:
<LI>FORCED PARAMETERIZATION can be set at the database level. This makes SQL Server become much more aggressive in deciding which queries to auto-parameterize. The down-side of this option is that it could potentially introduce parameter-sensitivity problems. (This option was also available in SQL Server 2005).
<LI>OPTIMIZE FOR ADHOC WORKLOADS is a new sp_configure server level option. When set, SQL Server only caches a plan stub on the first execution of an ad-hoc query. The next time the same query is executed, the full plan is stored. Plan stubs are much smaller than query plans and this option ensures that the plan cache is not filled by query plans that have never been reused.

<B>Description:</B> Number of SQL re-compiles per second that measures the number of times that a statement executed, but had to be compiled again before the statement completed. There are a variety of reasons that a recompile occured such as statistics being out of date, an column was added to a table a store procedure depends on, statement was run with a recompile option, etc. This counter needs to be as close to 0 as possible. A recompile can cause deadlocks and compile locks that are not compatible with any locking type.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>SQLServer:Access Methods Full Scans/sec compared to Index/Searches</B>
<BR><B>Description:</B> This counter monitors the number of full scans on base tables or indexes. High values indicate that we may be having performance issues due to table / index page scans. If we see high CPU and / or drops in Page Life Expectancy (PLE) then we need to investigate this counter; however, if full scans are on small tables we can safely ignore this counter as this counter tracks all full table scans, not just those on large tables. A few of the main causes of high Full Scans/sec are missing indexes, too many rows requested, queries with missing indexes, or too many rows requested will have a large number of logical reads and an increased CPU time.
<BR>
This analysis throws a Warning alert if the ratio of Index Searches/sec to Full Scans/sec is less than 1000 to 1 and if there are more than 1000 Index Searches/sec.
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> This counter monitors the number of full scans on tables or indexes. This counter can be ignored unless there is also high CPU use along with high scan rates. High scan rates may be caused by missing indexes, very small tables, or requests for too many records. 
<BR><B>Threshold: </B>
<BR>Yellow: A ratio of more than 1 full scan for every 1000 index searches. The value of Index Searches/sec and Full Scans/sec should be greater than 1000.
<BR><BR>Formula: 
(AvgSQLServerAccessMethodsIndexSearchessecAll / AvgSQLServerAccessMethods_FullScanssec) < 1000
<BR><BR><B>Next Steps:</B>
The main causes of high Full Scans/sec are:
<LI>Missing indexes
<LI>Too many rows requested
Queries with missing indexes or too many rows requested will have a large number of logical reads and an increased CPU time. As mentioned, if there is a high level of Full Scans to Index Searches, then it is important to also check the following:
See PERFMON SQLServer:Buffer Manager performance counters for memory pressure:
<LI>Page Life Expectancy
<LI>Checkpoint pages/sec
<LI>Lazy writes/sec
A high number of scans can cause buffer pool pressure (as indicated with low PLE and a higher Lazy Writes / sec count).
Memory pressure will quickly manifest into disk pressure, so also check:
See PERFMON Physical Disk performance counters: 
<LI>Disk sec/read
<LI>Disk sec/write
Note: Identify disk bottlenecks by using Performance Counters, Profiler, sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats and SHOWPLAN output.
Also refer to the sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats dynamic management view (DMV) to track io_stalls to help identify IO bottlenecks. 
To back up and support this information, compare the counters to sys.dm_os_wait_stats output. If you see high values in perfmon, you may also see high waits for the following:
<LI>ASYNC_IO_COMPLETION
<LI>IO_COMPLETION
<LI>PAGEIOLATCH_* (Data page I/O completion waits appear as PAGEIOLATCH_* waits)
Reactively, SQL Profiler can be used to identify which SQL statements are causing scans. Use the scans event class and events scan:started and scan:completed. Include the object ID data column. Save the profiler trace to a file and then convert it to trace table. You can then search for the scans event. 
The scan:completed event provides the associated IO so that you can also search for high reads, writes, and duration.

<BR>
<BR><B>Description:</B> Lock Requests/sec reports the number of new locks and lock conversions requested from the lock manager per second. A Lock Requests/sec greater than 500 when compared to Batch Request/sec indicates that batches are acquiring a large number of locks. 
This suggests inefficient queries and there is a risk is that blocking may occur. 
Threshold: (Yellow) - This value should not be greater than 50% of the number of Batch Requests/Sec

	<DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Total wait time (milliseconds) for locks that started in the last second.
<BR>Although a sustained average of 500 or more milliseconds can indicate that your SQL Server is spending too much time waiting for locks, also watch for peaks that exceed 60 seconds for extended blocking for a given workload in your system.
<BR><B>Recommendation:</B> Look for peaks that approach or exceed 60 seconds. 
<BR>Even though this counter counts how many total milliseconds SQL Server is waiting on locks over the last second, the counter actually records the lock wait time for a particular lock wait at the end of the locking event.  
<BR>The following methods can be used to reduce lock contention and increase overall throughput:  
<BR><LI>Avoid situations in which many processes are attempting to perform updates or inserts on the same data page.  
<BR><LI>Avoid transactions that include user interaction. Because locks are held for the duration of the transaction, a single user can degrade the entire systems performance.  
<BR><LI>Keep transactions that modify data as short as possible. The longer the transaction, the longer the exclusive or update locks are held. This blocks other activity and can lead to an increased number of deadlock situations.  
<BR><LI>Keep transactions in one batch. Unanticipated network problems may delay transactions from completing and thus releasing locks.  
<BR><LI>Avoid pessimistic locking hints such as holdlock whenever possible. They can cause processes to wait even on shared locks.  
<BR><LI>In most cases, you should use SQL Server's default isolation level. The isolation level determines at what point the tradeoffs are made between concurrency and consistency. If you have a strong business need for a higher isolation level, make sure that you evaluate all the tradeoffs and perform thorough testing under a high stress load.  
<BR><LI>Reduce the fillfactor when creating an index to help diminish the chance of random updates requiring the same page. This is especially useful for small tables that are frequently accessed.  
<BR><LI>If you are using DB-Library (DB-Lib), optimistic concurrency control can be specified by using the CCUR_OPTCC setting in dbcursoropen(). This option ensures that update locks are obtained only when a user wants to commit a transaction.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[Latch Waits/sec and Total Latch Wait Time (ms) can be correlated to find the average latch wait time.
<BR>If each latch wait is more than 10 milliseconds on average, your SQL Server may be spending too much time waiting on the various latches. It could also be facing resource contention as a result.

<B>Description:</B>
% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this counter.

This counter measures the percentage of total processor time spent (user mode and kernel mode) on SQL Server process threads. If this counter stays at 80% for sustained periods of time, then you may also wish to investigate other Process (sqlservr) such as Private Bytes, Virtual Bytes, and Working Set to get a better understanding of how SQL Server allocates certain segments of memory. 

<BR>
<B>Threshold:</B>
<BR><B>Red:</B> SQL Server is using more than 30% user mode CPU usage

<B>Description</B> Ratio between cache hits and lookups

The Plan Cacheobject provides counters to monitor how SQL Server uses memory to store objects such as stored procedures, ad hoc and prepared Transact-SQL statements, and triggers. Multiple instances of the Plan Cache object can be monitored at the same time, with each instance representing a different type of plan to monitor.
<BR><BR><B>Compiled Plan Stubs & Plan Cache Perf Counters:</B>
<LI>Cache Pages: Reports pages for compiled plans and compiled plan stubs
<LI>Cache Object Count: Includes compiled plans stubs
<LI>Cache Hit Ratio: Not incremented for compiled plan stub hits
<BR><BR>
In SQL Server 2008 R2, there are three options that can help in dealing with plan cache pollution issues.
<LI>FORCED PARAMETERIZATION can be set at the database level. This makes SQL Server become much more aggressive in deciding which queries to auto-parameterize. The down-side of this option is that it could potentially introduce parameter-sensitivity problems. (This option was also available in SQL Server 2005).
<LI>OPTIMIZE FOR ADHOC WORKLOADS is a new sp_configure server level option. When set, SQL Server only caches a plan stub on the first execution of an ad-hoc query. The next time the same query is executed, the full plan is stored. Plan stubs are much smaller than query plans and this option ensures that the plan cache is not filled by query plans that have never been reused.
<LI>DBCC FREESYSTEMCACHE can be used to clear the cache of plans associated with a particular Resource Governor resource pool. This could be useful when executed periodically if ad-hoc queries are able to be isolated into identifiable resource pools. (This command was also available in SQL Server 2005 but the option to clear a specific resource pool was added in SQL Server 2008).

<BR>
<BR><B>Description:</B> Percentage of work tables created where the initial two pages of the work table were not allocated but were immediately available from the work table cache. 

Since SQL Server 2005 worktable caching was improved. When a query execution plan is cached, the work tables needed by the plan are not dropped across multiple executions of the plan but merely truncated. In addition, the first nine pages for the work table are kept. In SQL Server 2000, the work tables used during query plan execution are dropped. Because the work table is cached, the next execution of the query is faster. When the system is low on memory, the execution plan may be removed from the cache and the associated work tables dropped as well. Both SQL Server 2000 and SQL Server 2005 use a small global pool of pre-allocated pages and extents that make the initial creation of work tables faster.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> When a work table is dropped, two pages may remain allocated and they are returned to the work table cache. A value less than 90% may indicate insufficient memory, since execution plans are being dropped, or may indicate, on 32-bit systems, the need for an upgrade to a 64-bit system.

<BR><BR><B>Threshold:</B>
<BR>Yellow: Less than 90% Worktables from Cache Ratio. This will need to be baselined for accuracy.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>SQLServer:Access Methods Table Lock Escalations/sec</B>
<BR><B>Description:</B>
The number of times locks on a table were escalated from page- or row-level to table-level. Frequent or even occasional spiking in this value may indicate poorly coded transactions.
<BR>

<B>Lock Escalation Thresholds</B>
<BR>
Lock escalation is triggered when lock escalation is not disabled on the table by using the ALTER TABLE SET LOCK_ESCALATION option, and when either of the following conditions exists: 
<UL>
  <LI>A single Transact-SQL statement acquires at least 5,000 locks on a single nonpartitioned table or index.</IL>
  <LI>A single Transact-SQL statement acquires at least 5,000 locks on a single partition of a partitioned table and the ALTER TABLE SET LOCK_ESCALATION option is set to AUTO.</IL>
  <LI>The number of locks in an instance of the Database Engine exceeds memory or configuration thresholds.</IL>
</UL>
If locks cannot be escalated because of lock conflicts, the Database Engine periodically triggers lock escalation at every 1,250 new locks acquired.
<BR>
<B>Next Steps</B>
<BR><B>Reducing Locking and Escalation</B><BR> 
In most cases, the Database Engine delivers the best performance when operating with its default settings for locking and lock escalation. If an instance of the Database Engine generates a lot of locks and is seeing frequent lock escalations, consider reducing the amount of locking by: 
<BR><BR>Using an isolation level that does not generate shared locks for read operations.
<UL>
<LI>READ COMMITTED isolation level when the READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT database option is ON.</LI>
<LI>SNAPSHOT isolation level.</LI>
<LI>READ UNCOMMITTED isolation level. This can only be used for systems that can operate with dirty reads.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Note:</B> Changing the isolation level affects all tables on the instance of the Database Engine.
<UL>
<LI>Using the PAGLOCK or TABLOCK table hints to have the Database Engine use page, heap, or index locks instead of row locks. Using this option, however, increases the problems of users blocking other users attempting to access the same data and should not be used in systems with more than a few concurrent users.</LI>
<LI>For partitioned tables, use the LOCK_ESCALATION option of ALTER TABLEto escalate locks to the HoBT level instead of the table or to disable lock escalation.</LI>
</UL> 
You can also use trace flags 1211 and 1224 to disable all or some lock escalations. For more information, see Trace Flags (Transact-SQL). Also, monitor lock escalation by using the SQL Server Profiler Lock:Escalation event; and see Using SQL Server Profiler.

The version cleanup rate in KB per seconds.<BR>

Monitors the version cleanup rate in KBps in all version stores. If the version cleanup rate is lower than the version generation rate, the version store will use more and more space in tempdb. However, if the version cleanup rate is 0 but the version generation rate is not, there is probably a long-running transaction that is preventing the version store cleanup.
<BR>
Row versions are shared across sessions. The creator of the row version has no control over when the row version can be reclaimed. You will need to find and then possibly stop the longest-running transaction that is preventing the row version cleanup.
<BR>The following query returns the top two longest-running transactions that depend on the versions in the version store:
<BR> <B>
select top 2 <BR>
    transaction_id, <BR> 
    transaction_sequence_num, <BR>

<B>Description:</B> The version generation rate in KB per seconds.

You can use the Version Generation Rate and Version Cleanup Rate counters to measure version store impact on TempDB. THe Version Generation Rate should not outpace the Cleanup Rate. Additionally, if your Version Cleanup Rate is 0, a long-running transaction could be preventing the version store cleanup. Incidentally, before generating an out-of-tempdb-space error, SQL Server 2008 makes a last-ditch attempt by forcing the version stores to shrink. During the shrink process, the longest-running transactions that have not yet generated any row versions are marked as victims. This frees up the version space used by them. Message 3967 is generated in the error log for each such victim transaction. If a transaction is marked as a victim, it can no longer read the row versions in the version store or create new ones. Message 3966 is generated and the transaction is rolled back when the victim transaction attempts to read row versions. If the shrink of the version store succeeds, more space is available in tempdb. Otherwise, tempdb runs out of space.

If TempDB fills and runs out of space, writes will continue, butversions will not and reads will fail.

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>SQLServer:SQL Plan Re-Use Rate</B>
<BR>
Plan re-use is desirable for OLTP workloads because re-creating the same plan (for similar or identical transactions) is a waste of CPU resources. 
<BR>To compute the plan re-use rate, compare SQL Server SQL Statistics: batch requests/sec to SQL compilations/sec.
<BR>Special exception to the plan re-use rule is that zero (or trivial) cost plans will not be cached (not re-used) in SQL 2005 SP2 and above. 
<BR>Applications that use zero cost plans will have a lower plan re-use but this is not a performance issue, because it is cheaper to generate a new plan every time than to cache.

<BR>
Number of pages which are not from NUMA-local memory.
<BR>
When we are using NUMA architecture which is becoming more common you will see memory nodes. We have one memory node per NUMA node and this is used to allocate memory in a particular node. This is visible in the SQL Server Buffer Node perfmon group. If you want to make sure you are performing local memory access versus foreign memory access we need to pay attention to where the memory is being allocated which can be tracked via sys.dm_os_memory_nodes. 

If we do not have enough memory in a particular NUMA node, we will perform a foreign access if we have to, but SQL Server tries to avoid this.

<BR>
When Indirect Checkpoints is enabled at the database level, you will notice a new background thread in sys.dm_exec_requests with the command token "RECOVERY WRITER". There is a single background writer for the SQL Server instance. The background writer performs aggressive flushing of dirty pages based on LSN order and reduces the redo phase recovery time.

The catalog view sys.databases contains a column named target_recovery_time_in_seconds that indicates whether a specific database is using the new Indirect checkpoint algorithm. There is a new performance monitor counter called 'Background writer pages/sec' that exposes the amount of dirty pages processed by the background writer. 

SQL Server Books Online contains a discussion about Indirect Checkpoints and how it interacts with the recovery interval setting:

    <DESCRIPTION><![CDATA[<B>SQLServer_Buffer Manager Page Life Expectancy</B>
<BR>
<B>Description:</B>
Number of seconds a page will stay in the buffer pool without references. This performance monitor counter tells you, on average, how long data pages are staying in the buffer. Any large drops of 30% or more should be investigated. Below 600 should be monitored and very low values near zero are considered a critical state. For monitoring, we are alerting at a warning level at 600 and a critical state of lower than 300 seconds, though getting a baseline is the best approach.
<BR>
When page life expectancy gets too low, this is an indication that SQL Server is doing too many logical reads putting pressure on the buffer pool. It is recommended to correlate page life expectancy with lazy writer activity. When page life expectancy becomes low, then SQL Server will respond by sweeping through the buffer pool using the lazy writer, increasing lazy writer activity. Low page life expectancy may cause more physical reads increasing pressure on disk and slowing down SQL Server responsiveness.
<BR>
The Page life expectancy counter is considered one of the most critical counters for SQL Server. If Page life expectancy becomes low SQL Server will attempt physical reads from disk into the buffer pool to honor requests. Requests from physical disk will take considerably longer causing higher disk costs. 
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> NUMA systems will have a CPU and memory grouping per node. If the server is a NUMA environment you should analyze the Buffer Node counters for Page Life Expectancy per node. You can tell a server is a NUMA system by checking the SQL Server error log or by querying sys.dm_os_memory_nodes. A non-NUMA system will have 2 nodes listed, A NUMA system will have additional nodes for each of the hardware NUMA nodes in the system.
<BR><B>Threshold:</B>
<BR><B>Yellow:</B> Page life expectancy is less than 10 minutes (600 seconds)
<BR><B>Red:</B> Page life expectancy is less than 5 minutes (300 seconds)

<BR><B>Next Steps:</B><BR>
If Buffer Manager\Page life expectancy is low then the Buffer Manager\Lazy Writes /sec will be higher as the Lazy Writer will become active attempting to free the buffer cache as SQL Server will be under memory pressure.
Due to the disk impact of the physical reads incurred, the \Physical Disk \Avg. Disk sec/Read counter may also become a bottleneck as SQL Server is reading from disk instead of the buffer pull to honor requests.
Look for an increase in SQL Server: Buffer Manager: Checkpoint Pages/sec and SQL Server:Buffer Manager: Lazy Writes/sec performance object counters because SQL Server 2005 / 2008 starts to flush pages out of the buffer pool cache under memory pressure.
Run expensive queries through the Database Tuning Advisor (DTA), look for queries with a high number of logical reads and consider tuning and potentially rewriting them, and potentially add additional memory if non-hardware options to not address the issue.
